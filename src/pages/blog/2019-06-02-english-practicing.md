I've been practicing english with Duolingo for a month or a bit more. 

I improve my listening and write so much. Really, I couldn't believe that I could do it so quickly.

Of course I am still a newbie and often check some words on the web, but I am feeling more confident. 

I've already watched 4 or 5 movies with english subtitles only. It is a start. 

Maybe it could be a good idea watching something with no subtitle at all in next days.
