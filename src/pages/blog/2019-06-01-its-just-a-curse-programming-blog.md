I am starting this simple shit because I am in a dangerous way. 

As a programmer I am stuck. As a Brazilian I am lost. 

The country is falling apart due the political state of madness promoted by the new gang in power. 

So, I must to find a way to survive, and preserve my mental health without get arrested or lose my job while I trying to find out a way to get out of here. 

Let's see if I can do this.
